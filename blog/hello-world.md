This is my first blog post. In this article, I will introduce how to build a personal website using Deno and the Fresh framework.

## Why Choose Deno and Fresh?

Deno is a modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime that provides many built-in features such as TypeScript support, ES modules, and security. Fresh is a full-stack web framework based on Deno that offers server-side rendering, zero configuration, and instant hot updates.

## Getting Started

To start using Deno and Fresh, you first need to install Deno:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

Then, you can create a new project using Fresh's scaffolding tool:

```bash
deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev my-website
```

## Summary

Deno and Fresh are a powerful combination that can help us quickly build modern web applications. They provide many out-of-the-box features that allow us to focus on business logic rather than configuration.
